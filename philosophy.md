<h1 class="display-1 main-heading mb-4" id="">Teaching Philosophy</h1>

My teaching philosophy is based on three core values: Vision, Willingness, and Execution. Through years of teaching, I have discovered that all three are essential to success inside and outside of the classroom.

## Vision
__What is vision?__  
Vision is a student’s inner creativity. It is the ability to internally manifest an idea or artifact.

__Why is vision essential?__  
Imagine a block of marble. To the non-creative, it is seen only at face value as a raw material. However, the astute sculptor can look within the marble and see its potential— perhaps they imagine a majestic lion or fearless warrior.

Most creatives are measured by their output; what we can see and interact with in the physical world. However, we can’t create in the physical world without creating in our mind’s eye.

__How can instructors facilitate vision in the classroom?__  
In education, there is a large focus on the use of tools and technology (e.g. Adobe Photoshop) to complete contrived assignments. Students will benefit most when they are taught not only how to use the tool/technology, but also how to conceive of ideas and bring them into reality.

In my classes, I always engage students in a regular practice of “inspos”— looking at inspiration and work from seasoned creative professionals. In the same way that a healthy diet supports a healthy body— the regular consumption of inspiring creative media will sustain the ‘creative metabolism’ of our students.

Another practice I use is guided visualization. As a hypnotherapist, I apply my understanding of the subconscious mind and its ability to stimulate vision. Students often struggle because they have not taken time to imagine the end goal of their project. By taking a few minutes to relax, close their eyes, and envision the final work, students end up with a creative “GPS Point” that helps them to navigate to a successful finished product. This ensures that they always know whether their actions take them closer to or further from their goal.

## Willingness
__What is willingness?__  
Willingness is the commitment and decision to pursue one’s vision.

__Why is willingness essential?__  
A vision that isn’t executed remains a fantasy. When one becomes willing, they are prepared to make great sacrifices and go to any lengths to fulfill their vision.

Students have complicated and demanding lives in which they must meet professional obligations while integrating social development and managing their health.

One of the most challenging societal narratives I encounter is the idea that one’s path to success should be comfortable, happy, and pleasant. In reality, success requires students to be uncomfortable, take risks, face fears, confront challenges, learn from failures, and navigate uncertainty.

__How can instructors facilitate willingness in the classroom?__  
I have noticed a tendency for students to focus just on getting through the class and satisfying course requirements.

Every semester, I take several moments to have interactive discussions about personal and professional development. In this way I can assess student attitudes about their work and career path and provide insights and encouragement.

Some discussion topics include:
 - The value of intention
 - Living at the cause vs. living at the effect
 - How do you define success?

Willingness also means encouraging students to be open-minded and challenge preconceived ideas about work, life, and creativity. This usually means a shift from convergent thinking (one ‘correct’ answer) to divergent thinking in the classroom.

Above all, an attitude of willingness means a shift from passivity into action and engagement.

## Execution
__What is execution?__  
Execution is the action that fulfills the vision.

__Why is execution essential?__  
Now that our student has a vision, and the willingness to carry it out, they take the actions necessary.

If vision is the outcome, then execution is the process. In spite of society’s obsession with output and results, we should focus more on the creative process than the outcome.

__How can instructors facilitate execution in the classroom?__  
My approach to execution is project-based learning with measurable ‘milestones’. Many of my undergraduate semesters were spent in rote memorization and regurgitation of material, only to forget it all shortly after. Projects serve as testament to execution.

In my Web & Mobile Design classes, students assemble an interactive, responsive portfolio in Webflow. In addition to showcasing their work, students also document their creative process.

Accountability drives execution. This takes the form of presentations and group critiques.

Final Thoughts
These three pillars can also serve as an inventory. I find that most people are stronger in one category than the others. When encountering challenges, a student can ask themselves in which category they are struggling, and then make a concerted effort to rectify it.

I have found in over five years of teaching college classes that the best way to implement this system is to model it myself by practicing these three pillars every day.
